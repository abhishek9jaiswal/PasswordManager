# Password Manager Readme

---

## Overview:
This Password Manager is a simple GUI application built using Python and Tkinter. It allows users to securely store and retrieve passwords for different websites along with their usernames. The passwords are encrypted using the Fernet symmetric encryption algorithm from the cryptography library.

---

## Features:
1. **Secure Encryption:** Passwords are encrypted using Fernet encryption with a key derived from the user's master password. This ensures that stored passwords remain secure.
2. **User-Friendly Interface:** The GUI interface makes it easy for users to enter and retrieve passwords without needing to remember them manually.
3. **Local Storage:** Encrypted passwords are stored locally in memory during the session, ensuring data privacy.
4. **Password Retrieval:** Users can retrieve their stored passwords by entering the website and username associated with the password.

## Dependencies:
1. Python 3.x
2. Tkinter (standard Python library for GUI)
3. cryptography library (install using `pip install cryptography`)

---

## How to Use:
1. Run the script `password_manager.py`.
2. Enter your master password in the provided field and click "Submit."
3. Once authenticated, the main Password Manager window will appear.
4. Enter the website, username, and password in the respective fields.
5. Click "Save Password" to encrypt and save the password locally.
6. To retrieve a password, enter the website and username and click "Retrieve Password."

## Important Notes:
1. **Master Password:** The security of your passwords depends on the strength of your master password. Choose a strong and unique master password.
2. **Security Concerns:** While this application provides local encryption, ensure your system is secure and free from malware or unauthorized access.
3. **Backup:** Consider backing up your encrypted password storage file periodically to avoid data loss.
4. **Customization:** You can modify the password storage logic (`get_encrypted_password` and `save_encrypted_password` functions) to integrate with a database or secure storage solution.
